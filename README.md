# CIFAR-10-Transfer-Learning
Comprehensive notebook on CIFAR-10 Transfer learning with fine tuning

In this notebook, we saw different cnn models and their performance on CIFAR-10 dataset. I also implemented data augmentation on the data but it didn't improve our accuracy so i commented the codes. Feel free to change the codes and try it yourself by the way. Also it's notable that fine tuning can tend to overfitting so number of epochs, batch_size, dropout, and etc are important hyperparameters in order to avoid overfitting. 

### Main Topics Covvered
  - Loading Data & Data Preprocessing
  - Custom CNN Model
  - Implement AlexNet from Scratch
  - ResNet50 (fine tuning)
  - MobileNet
  - Conclusion
